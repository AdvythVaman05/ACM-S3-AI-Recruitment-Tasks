This folder contains two variations of Image Segmentation. One performed using KMeans Clustering algorithm from Sci-Kit library whereas the other performed using KMeans Clustering algorithm built from scratch. The scores of my KMeans Clustering algorithm are:-
1. Silhouette Score : 0.8353
2. Davies-Bouldin Index : 0.5896
3. Inertia : 398.791

The scores of Scikit Learn KMeans algorithm are as follows:-
1. Silhouette Score : 0.8353
2. Davies-Bouldin Index : 0.5900
3. Inertia : 398.781
